Reminder: Issues are a great place to file bug reports and make specific requests for features. They aren't a great place for asking questions about the project â€“ please consider using social media, the Hacking with Swift Slack workspace, or the Hacking with Swift forums for that. So, before you continue please make sure the issue you're filing is about a bug or a feature request. Thank you!
