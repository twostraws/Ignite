/// A Process extension that knows how to run a command and
/// return its result. To make things easier, this also knows how
/// to execute a subsequent command while the first one is
/// running, which is important for previewing on a local server.
///
/// Important: This runs all commands through `/bin/bash -c`,
/// which allows us to `kill` a specific process ID belonging
/// to the user.
extension Process {
    /// Runs a command, optionally followed by a second command.
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - command: The full command to execute. This must be passed as a string
    ///   even though an array might seem better, because `bash -c` executes the
    ///   command as the current user, and that also needs the whole command to be
    ///   passed as a single string rather than an array that is more common.
    ///   - subsequentCommand: A second command to run. Used when previewing the
    ///   local site in a web browser.
    /// - Returns: The contents of stdout and stderr as a tuple.
